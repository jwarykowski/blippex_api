# blippex_api
A ruby wrapper for the blippex search engine made bythe people, forthe people.

You can find out more about the Blippex API [here](https://archify.atlassian.net/wiki/display/blippexAPI/api.blippex.org).

## Documentation
* Original documenation: <https://archify.atlassian.net/wiki/display/blippexAPI/api.blippex.org>
* Gem documentation: <http://rubydoc.info/gems/blippex_api>

## Getting Started
In order to be able to send API requests you'll first need to install the `blippex_api` gem.

```ruby
gem install blippex_api
```

Once you have completed the steps above, you can now create an instance of a `BlippexAPI::Client`:

```ruby
require 'blippex_api'
api = BlippexAPI::Client.new
```

If you now look at your `BlippexAPI` object instance it will be similar to the following:

```ruby
<BlippexAPI::Client:0x007fe9a23055f0
@adapter=:net_http,
@api_endpoint="https://api.blippex.org/",
@user_agent="BlippexAPI Ruby Gem 1.0.0">
```

## Example requests
Now that you have an `BlippexAPI::Client` instance you can now make requests.

### info endpoint

```ruby
api.info
```

The response is returned within a `Hashie::Mash` instance.

## Tests
There are a number of unit tests which are included as part of this project, please run:

```ruby

Please note that a number of tests still need to be added so I don't currently have complete coverage, subject to workload these will be slowly added over the next few months.
